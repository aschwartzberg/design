            Have you ever looked at a furniture catalogue and thought, "how do they do it?" The perfectly coordinated clothes in the closet, the organized desk accessories, the fun photos with friends on the walls? Your room is more than just a place to put furniture - it's where your life starts. Here at ROOMLYF, we want to help you complete your perfect lifestyle with the things that furniture catalogues <em>won't</em> sell you.
            
            Effortless style - with a little bit of help.
